# Player's Guide to Ballista Command
Welcome to Meteor Defense, a fast-paced strategy game where you defend your cities and ballistae from incoming waves of meteorites. As the commander of the defense units, you'll need quick reflexes and strategic planning to survive the onslaught. This guide will introduce you to the game mechanics, controls, and strategies to help you protect your bases.

# Objective
Your primary objective is to protect your cities and ballistae from being destroyed by meteorites. Each wave increases in difficulty, bringing more meteorites at varying speeds and angles. The game continues until all cities are destroyed. Your score is determined by the number of meteorites you destroy, with bonus points awarded for surviving cities and unused bombs at the end of each wave.

# Game Elements
Cities: Your main assets. Once all cities are destroyed, the game ends.
Ballistae: Defensive units that shoot bombs at incoming meteorites. Initially, you have three ballistae positioned at strategic points on the screen.
Meteorites: The primary threat. These vary in size and speed, and successfully destroying them increases your score. After wave 2 they have a small chance to split into 2 meteors.
Bombs: The projectiles shot by your ballistae. They can be detonated to create an explosion that can destroy meteorites.
Bombers: After wave 2, bombers fly over head dropping yellow meteors straight down.
Controls
Mouse Click: Aim and shoot a bomb from the nearest ballista to the cursor location. Even if a ballista is disabled, the nearest operational ballista will shoot.
Spacebar: Detonates the first bomb launched, causing an explosion. Subsequent presses detonate the next bombs in the order they were fired.
Scoring
You earn points by destroying meteorites. The base score for each meteorite destroyed is 25 points, multiplied by the wave multiplier:

Waves 1–2: 1x multiplier
Waves 3–4: 2x multiplier
Waves 5–6: 3x multiplier
Waves 7–8: 4x multiplier
Waves 9–10: 5x multiplier
Waves 11+: 6x multiplier
Bonus points are awarded at the end of each wave based on the number of surviving cities and unused bombs (100 for each surviving city and 5 for each remaining ballistae bomb multiplied by the wave mutlipliers).

# Strategy Tips
Prioritize Targets: Focus on meteorites that pose an immediate threat to your cities and ballistae.
Bomb Timing: Detonate bombs strategically to maximize the area of effect and chain reactions with nearby meteorites.
Wave Multiplier: Keep the wave multiplier in mind when planning your defense, as destroying meteorites in later waves significantly increases your score.
Ballista Management: Even if a ballista is disabled by a meteorite hit, you can still fire from other ballistae by clicking anywhere on the screen. Manage your ballistae wisely to ensure coverage across the entire screen.
City Restoration: For every 10,000 points earned, one destroyed city will be restored at the end of the wave. Plan your strategy to maximize your score and keep your cities protected.
Game Over and Restarting
The game ends when all cities are destroyed. Your final score will be displayed, and you can restart the game to try and achieve a higher score.

We hope this guide helps you get started with Meteor Defense. Good luck, commander, and protect those cities!
